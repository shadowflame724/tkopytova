                                Hello! My name is Tetiana. I have two passions: children’s illustration and painting horses.

                                I am a professional artist and book illustrator. I have master's degree in arts. My main specializations are 2D graphic and illustration. I have 6+ years’ experience as a game artist and 10+ years’ experience as a children's books illustrator. More than 15 books illustrated by me were published. I do both digital (Adobe Photoshop) and watercolor illustrations.

                                My second passion is painting horses. I specialize on oil paintings on canvas and graphic drawings. My art pieces were showed in several exhibitions; my horse paintings are in private collections all over the world. Horses are my inspiration and a big part of my life.
